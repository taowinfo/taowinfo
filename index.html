						<h3><b>My Story</b></h3>
					</div>
				</div><!-- col-sm-3 -->
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p class="margin-b-30">
						I am deeply interested in the dynamic between people and technologies: how our behaviors inform the design of technologies
						and how technologies change our everyday behaviors. The Human Computer Interaction (HCI) class that I took during my
						undergraduate study initiated this passion. I learned more about the field when conducting the research required by
						the BSc(Hons) degree, where I picked an HCI topic. However, the real breakthrough came when I volunteered with the
						local Special Olympic community. I witnessed the challenges that people with special needs and their caretakers face
						and the joy that they express, often upon some minor things. I started to think more profoundly about the relationship
						between technologies and their users. This growing curiosity led me to pursue a Ph.D. through the Department of Informatics,
						University of California Irvine in 2011.
					</p>
					<p class="margin-b-30">Since then, I have contributed to more than ten HCI projects, including five projects that I
						led from start to finish. My reading and hands-on experiences allowed me to gain an in-depth understanding of various
						research methods including their strengths and shortcomings. Along the way, I have also developed my own identity as
						a researcher. Information technologies have social impact, especially for people who are disadvantaged by their abilities
						or social context. I wish to use my skills to develop information technologies that can improve the quality of life
						for these individuals, and maybe the seemingly small improvements can ripple and unlock the full potential of their
						lives.
					</p>
					<p class="margin-b-30">In the past a few years, my main focus was on my dissertation research, which comprised three
						projects/phases. In this research, I looked at an often neglected problem that blind users encounter: the communication,
						awkward at times, with sighted users in regard to interacting web pages. I used both qualitative methods and quantitative
						methods to investigate the root of the issues and assess a potential design solution. Through this research, I have
						gained interesting insights and produced various design suggestions at each phase. I successfully defended my dissertation
						on May 16th, 2018.
					</p>
					<p class="margin-b-30">Currently, I am in the job market. So please get in touch if you have good suggestions. I do not know what life will 
						take me next. But I do know that I want to dedicate my career to research and work on good topics that can impact people's lives. 
						I can’t imagine anything else more satisfying than that!</p>

						<h4><b>Understanding the Communication Barriers tetween Sighted and Blind Web Users</b></h4>
						<h5 class="margin-tb-30 font-green">
							<div><b>Problem</b></div>
						</h5>
						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							No man is an island. Communication with others is essential when performing many tasks. However, prior research has reported
							that blind web users experienced difficulties when discussing web pages with sighted web users. One plausible explanation
							is that blind users use screen readers to access web pages, which convey content via synthesized speech. This is dramatically
							different from how sighted users perceive web pages. This leads to communication barriers when describing web pages.
							In this research, my goal was to clarify what the specific issues were. Such an understanding is necessary as it informs
							what a design solution should address.
						</p>
						<h5 class="font-green margin-tb-30">
							<div><b>Method</b></div>
						</h5>
						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							I conducted a content analysis study. The idea was to collect written instructions for simple web-based tasks and analyze
							what wording and patterns were problematic for screen reader users. I distributed online surveys on Amazon Mechanical
							Turk and collected 50+ unique responses.
						</p>
						<h5 class="font-green margin-tb-30">
							<div><b>Findings</b></div>
						</h5>
						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							I found two consistent, problematic patterns among other minor patterns from the data. First, spatial terms, such as “top
							left,” “center,” were prevalent when sighted users described web elements. Since screen readers do not convey layout,
							blind users would not be able to make sense of these terms. Second, sighted users tend to use inconsistent terms to
							describe web elements. For example, they might describe the same top menu using “links,” “tabs,” or “text.” Since
							screen readers always use the technical web element names, blind users could get confused when receiving instructions
							featuring such terms.

						<h4><b>Spatial Audio with Web Audio API</b></h4>


						<h5 class="font-green margin-tb-30">
							<div><b>Problem</b></div>
						</h5>

						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							Web Audio API is a W3C work-in-progress specification that is supported by all major browsers. Using Web Audio API, a web
							developer can easily edit one or more audio sources during runtime and create sophisticated audio effect. I was particularly
							interested in its spatialization features as spatial audio has the potential to convey layout to web users with visual
							impairments. However, there is no known evaluation of the effectiveness of Web Audio API’s spatialization features.
							In addition, moving audio can provide more design options and a more animated experience. But compared to other design
							spaces, we know little about how to design good moving audio, e.g., do different movements lead to different recognition
							rates? Do spatial properties, such as distance, speed, play a role in recognition accuracy?
						</p>


						<h5 class="font-green margin-tb-30">
							<div><b>Method</b></div>
						</h5>
						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							To answer both questions, I designed and implemented two lab experiments: one focused on stationary spatial audio and the
							other focused on moving audio. I recruited 18 participants. Each session took about two hours and the participant
							completed recognition tasks of audio stimulus with various spatial properties. At the end, I collected more than 4000
							data points. Using ANOVA and non-parametric methods, I compared and identified regions that contribute to better or
							worse recognition rates. I also built multi-level general models to evaluate the role that different spatial properties

						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							Based on the analysis, I produced a few main spatial audio design guidelines, as well as a summary of observed patterns.
							The main findings include the recognition rates of stationary audio spatialized in the horizontal space for different
							resolutions, the recognition rates of various movement types and the impact of a moving audio’s length or direction,
							the ranges of less sensitive area in the audio space, and a recognition bias that users exhibited.

						<h4><b>Using Spatial Audio Feedback to Convey Web Page Layouts to Blind Screen Reader Users</b></h4>


						<h5 class="font-green margin-tb-30">
							<div><b>Problem</b></div>
						</h5>
						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							My early research has found that sighted people tend to use spatial terms when describing web pages, but spatial terms are
							problematic for blind screen reader users to comprehend. One potential solution is to convey layout information via
							spatial audio feedback. Currently, screen readers have not utilized spatial audio much and user attitudes about such
							designs are unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct formative research before any major development.
						</p>


						<h5 class="font-green margin-tb-30">
							<div><b>Method</b></div>
						</h5>
						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							I developed a proof-of-concept screen reader prototype that supports basic screen reader features and additional spatial
							audio features. Then I conducted user studies with 20 blind or legally blind participants. Each one-on-one session
							took about two hours. The user study includes usability testing, surveys, and interviews. The focus was on whether
							or not users could interpret relative spatial terms or perceive the overall web page layout using the prototype, and
							their direct feedback on the design concept.
						</p>

						<h5 class="font-green margin-tb-30">
							<div><b>Findings</b></div>
						</h5>
						<p class="margin-tb-30">
							Quantitative data collected from the usability testing and surveys shows that spatial audio features enabled participants
							to accomplish tasks that are hard or impossible to complete with regular screen readers. However, I also found that
							a user’s familiarity with screen readers had a strong impact to their experience with spatial audio features. For
							users who are new to screen readers, they had a hard time processing the additional spatial audio feedback. For experienced
							screen reader users, they responded positively to the spatial audio features in general, but a few were reluctant
							to incorporate new techniques into their existing interaction routines. From the interview, I also learned usability
							issues with my current design and various scenarios where spatial audio feedback could make positive impacts. These
							findings allowed me to compile a list of recommendations on how future developments should be focused.
